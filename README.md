# OpenThread on ESP32

**ot-esp32** is a port of OpenThread for the [Espressif ESP32 platform](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32/overview), where OpenThread uses a [Radio Co-Processor (RCP) design](https://openthread.io/platforms#radio-co-processor-rcp), transmitting and receiving radio using an 802.15.4-capable SoC.

For more information on OpenThread, see [openthread.io](https://openthread.io).
